  abstract    = {Social anxiety or the fear of being evaluated by others in social settings has been shown to contribute to impairments in interpersonal functioning. One way in which such impairments may arise is through biased perceptions of others during social interactions. The present study examined how social anxiety relates to the perception of interpersonal warmth from others within a relationship initiation context, and whether this relationship differs in men and women. Participants were 69 men and 69 women, aged 20.62 years on average (SD = 1.97), who identified as heterosexual. After completing a questionnaire pack online, participants engaged in a laboratory-based interaction with a previously unacquainted participant of the other sex. After the interaction, participants reported their perception of their partner's warmth. Results revealed a negative association between men's degree of social anxiety and their perception of their partner's warmth. This association was not found in women. The moderation of sex on the role of social anxiety in interpersonal perceptions may reflect sex differences in social cognitive abilities.},

  abstract    = {The social transmission of food preference, a rudimentary form of social learning, has primarily been studied in pairs of adult rodents. Here, we present a protocol to explore the parent-offspring context in social learning using an adaptation of this classic paradigm for rodent dam-pup dyads. We describe steps for studying weanling mice from the same mother and present a worked example using weight-based (food consumption) and time-based (exploration) indices of social learning.},
