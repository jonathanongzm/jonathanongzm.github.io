  abstract    = {Overinvolved parenting, also known as helicopter parenting, is generally regarded as a violation of a child’s basic psychological needs, which may hinder their development of social competence. Yet, helicopter parenting behaviors may not be appraised negatively in cultures where filial piety is a salient influence in child socialization processes. The current study examined associations between perceived childhood experiences of helicopter parenting and five domains of social competence in adulthood, and whether these associations varied by reciprocal and authoritarian filial piety. Findings from a cross-sectional survey conducted with 394 single adults (25--40 years) in Malaysia revealed that helicopter parenting was negatively related to competence in relationship initiation, but only among individuals lower in reciprocal filial piety. Helicopter parenting was not associated with other domains of social competence. Given the significant role of culture in shaping perceptions of parenting behaviors and outcomes, promoting mutual respect and emotional closeness in parent--child relationships may enhance the relational well-being of single adults in Malaysia.},

Here, we present a protocol to explore the parent--offspring context in social learning using an adaptation of this classic paradigm for rodent dam--pup dyads. We describe steps for studying weanling mice from the same mother and present a worked example using weight-based (food consumption) and time-based (exploration) indices of social learning.},

  abstract    = {Social anxiety or the fear of being evaluated by others in social settings has been shown to contribute to impairments in interpersonal functioning. One way in which such impairments may arise is through biased perceptions of others during social interactions. The present study examined how social anxiety relates to the perception of interpersonal warmth from others within a relationship initiation context, and whether this relationship differs in men and women. Participants were 69 men and 69 women, aged 20.62 years on average (SD = 1.97), who identified as heterosexual. After completing a questionnaire pack online, participants engaged in a laboratory-based interaction with a previously unacquainted participant of the other sex. After the interaction, participants reported their perception of their partner's warmth. Results revealed a negative association between men's degree of social anxiety and their perception of their partner's warmth. This association was not found in women. The moderation of sex on the role of social anxiety in interpersonal perceptions may reflect sex differences in social cognitive abilities.},
